        <h3>South Indian Cuisine</h3>

        <p>
            South Indian cuisine is known for its vibrant flavors, unique cooking techniques, and the use of fresh, locally grown
            ingredients like rice, coconut, tamarind, and curry leaves. The food is rich in flavor but often lighter and less oily
            than some other regional Indian cuisines.
